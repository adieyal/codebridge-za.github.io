<h1>What is Codebridge?</h1>
<div class="row">

	<div class="col-12">

	<p>Codebridge is a civic technology lab where we bring together programmers, activists and data journalists to create software that addresses difficult social problems. We are also home to a handful of software start-ups and support various software meetup groups with a space to meet. We are based in Claremont, Cape Town, the only hackerspace in the country that is situated under a bridge.</p>

<h2>Donations</h2>

  <p>
    The income membership fee is enough to cover the basics, but we survive off
    donations.
  </p>

<h3>Projector</h3>
<p>
  We are currently borrowing a projector for most events, but it
  would be great to have our own.
</p>

<h3>Desks and Chairs</h3>
<p>
  We are looking for tressel tables so that we can easily re-arrange the space for large hackathons. We have had a fair number of desks and chairs donated already, but we're always looking for more. Really anything goes - plastic chairs are very useful for overflow seating at events.
</p>

<h3>Whiteboards</h3>
<p>
  It seems we can never have enough. We ideally want some large wall sized ones, but the smaller ones are useful too.
</p>

<h3>Your Time</h3>
<p>
  Since we're entirely member-run there are whole lot of random jobs
  to do around the building (you know - taking out trash, etc.). This
  website also needs some work (and <a href="https://github.com/codebridge-za/codebridge-za.github.io">its on github!</a>)
